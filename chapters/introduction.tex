\chapter{Theoretical context} \label{ch:theory}


The \gls{SM} of particle physics is a theoretical framework that describes the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear interactions between elementary particles. 
Based on the principles of \gls{QFT}, it has been tested extensively and has been able to describe the observations of particle physics experiments with great accuracy. 
However, there are several phenomena that the \gls{SM} is not able to explain, such as the existence of \gls{DM} or the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. 
For reasons we will discuss later, many tensions with the \gls{SM} have been previously observed when quark's flavour transitions occur, such as in the $b \to s l^+ l^-$ or $b \to c \tau \nu$ transitions.
In this chapter, we will first introduce the theoretical framework behind the \gls{SM} and its limitations (\ref{sec:SM}), which will lead us to the formulation of the \gls{SM} as an \gls{EFT} (\ref{sec:EFT}) and the study of the $b \to s \nu \Bar{\nu}$ transition (\ref{sec:bsnn_SM}), which is the focus of this thesis.
Finally, we will mention \gls{NP} models which could intervene in the $b \to s \nu \Bar{\nu}$ transition and the experimental constraints on these models (\ref{sec:bsnn_NP}).
% Therefore, the \gls{SM} is considered an effective theory, and it is expected that it will be replaced by a more fundamental theory that can explain these phenomena.
