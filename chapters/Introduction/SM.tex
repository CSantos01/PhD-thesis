\section{The Standard Model of particle physics} \label{sec:SM}

The \gls{SM} provides mathematical tools to describe the interactions between elementary particles, which can be \textit{fermions}, with half-odd spin, or \textit{bosons}, with integer spin.
The elementary bosons, or \textit{gauge bosons}, act as mediators of the fundamental interactions: \textit{electromagnetic}, \textit{weak} and \textit{strong} interactions.
The elementary fermions are, in this theory, 12 particles (and 12 anti-particles) forming multiplets of the groups SU(3)$_C$, SU(2)$_L$ and U(1)$_Y$.

The $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ gauge group describes the electroweak interaction, mediated respectively by the $\left(W^i\right)_{i\in\llbracket1,3\rrbracket}$ and $B$ bosons, acting on the \textit{weak isospin} $T$ and the \textit{weak hypercharge} $Y$.

The SU(3)$_C$ gauge group describes the strong interaction, and act only on particles with a \textit{colour charge} $C\in\{R,G,B,\Bar{R},\Bar{G},\Bar{B}\}$. This group being of dimension 8, it has 8 gauge bosons, called \textit{gluons} $\left(g_i\right)_{i\in\llbracket0,8\rrbracket}$.
Elementary fermions can then be separated in two categories:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Quarks}, with a colour charge, which are grouped in three generations, each containing two quarks with electric charge $Q=\frac{2}{3}$ and one with $Q=-\frac{1}{3}$, as follows:
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{pmatrix}
                u \\
                d
            \end{pmatrix}
            \quad
            \begin{pmatrix}
                c \\
                s
            \end{pmatrix}
            \quad
            \begin{pmatrix}
                t \\
                b
            \end{pmatrix}
        \end{equation*}
        and their anti-particle equivalents. 
        As they interact with the strong nuclear force, quarks are never observed in isolation, but always in bound states called hadrons (except for the top quark because of its mass), since free particles must always have a "null" colour charge.
        Particles composed of two quarks are called mesons, and those composed of three quarks are called baryons.
        
        \item \textit{Leptons}, without a colour charge, which are also grouped in three generations, each containing a charged lepton and a neutrino, as follows:
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \nu_e \\
                e^-
            \end{pmatrix}
            \quad
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \nu_\mu \\
                \mu^-
            \end{pmatrix}
            \quad
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \nu_\tau \\
                \tau^-
            \end{pmatrix}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
    and their anti-particle equivalents.

    All of the fermions interact weakly, and charged fermions also interact electromagnetically.
    From the way they act under $SU(2)_L$, one can write the fermions as \textit{weak-isospin doublets}
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \nu_e \\
            e^-
        \end{pmatrix}_L
        \quad
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \nu_\mu \\
            \mu^-
        \end{pmatrix}_L
        \quad
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \nu_\tau \\
            \tau^-
        \end{pmatrix}_L
        \quad
        \begin{pmatrix}
            u' \\
            d'
        \end{pmatrix}_L
        \quad
        \begin{pmatrix}
            c' \\
            s'
        \end{pmatrix}_L
        \quad
        \begin{pmatrix}
            t' \\
            b'
        \end{pmatrix}_L
    \end{equation*}

    and \textit{weak-isospin singlets}
    \begin{equation*}
        e^-_R
        \quad
        \mu^-_R
        \quad
        \tau^-_R
        \quad
        u'_R
        \quad
        c'_R
        \quad
        t'_R
        \quad
        d'_R
        \quad
        s'_R
        \quad
        b'_R
    \end{equation*}

    with the $L$ and $R$ subscripts indicating the chirality of the particles, left-handed or right-handed, respectively.
    The right-handed neutrinos are not included in the \gls{SM}.
